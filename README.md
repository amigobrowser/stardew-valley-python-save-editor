# Stardew Valley Save File Editor

## Information
This script is designed for version 1.6 of Stardew Valley. I don't know anything about compatibility with older versions, so it would be great if you could test it and share the results. It is compatible with PC and Android, but probably incompatible with consoles.

## Will My Save Files Be Okay?
This script makes backups of your saves every time you edit them. If something goes wrong, just check the `SAVE_BACKUP` folder, which should be in the same directory as the script.

## Installation

1. Download and unzip the file from the latest release.
2. Download Python and the `lxml` library.
3. Paste your saves into the same directory as the script. (It doesn't matter if they are inside a folder, the script will detect them anyway.)
4. You can now run the script.

## Usage

Choose the number of the file you want to edit, then use any of the following commands:

### Commands

- **money**: Edit current gold amount.
- **totalmoney**: Edit the amount of money ever earned.
- **player name**: Edit player name.
